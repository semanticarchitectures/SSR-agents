# SSR-agents

There are three main components to the SSR-agent prototype
1. Agents
2. Simulation
3. User Interface

Agents
Agents consist of a foundation model, long and short term memory, and an identity 

The identity is tied to a role with responsibilities and authorities
Long term memory is the training and background information relevant to this role
Short term memory is information about the current environment and priorities, as well as any specific instructions
The identity is unique to an instance of an agent

Agents can be coded using any framework  as long as their interfaces are all defined using natural language and they use a common identity management system

Simulation
The simulation provides the stimulus to the agents and consists of services and evaluation of models.

User Interface
The user interface enables users to modify the simulation and to interact with agents
